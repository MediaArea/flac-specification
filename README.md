# The FLAC Specification

This document defines FLAC, which stands for Free Lossless Audio Codec, a free, open-source codec for lossless audio compression and decompression.

This is currently a work in progress and welcomes [contributions and feedback](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Discussion of the plans for standardization should be regulated to the [CELLAR listserv](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/cellar/charter/).
